# ML_Revision_Data_Preprocessing
This code imports required libraries, loads a dataset from a CSV file, separates independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (y), and then splits the data into training and testing sets. The training data is used to build a machine learning model, while the testing data is used to evaluate its performance.
